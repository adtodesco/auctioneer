<hr>
<p>Welcome to the Don Orsillo Open free agency auction! The DOO free agency is done via sealed-bid auctions where the
    highest bid equals the players total salary. Free agency takes place here at <a
        href="{{url_for('home.index')}}">thedooauction.com</a> and results will be imported into fantrax at the end of
    free agency.</p>

<h3>Auction Rules</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Managers can nominate and bid on any player in the player pool with their bid equaling the total salary paid to
        the player if they win the auction.</li>
    <li>If a manager has match rights for a player they will get 24 hours to accept or decline the match option once the
        auction has closed. A manager has match rights if their player is on a minor league or free agency contract
        (i.e. if that player was <em>not</em> an in-season waiver claim). Check the <a target="_blank"
            href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p6XZBkywTkNDSrnoh7A86_ZFw-Ngtpm0Ulc0S9BA6oA/edit?usp=sharing">
            2024 FA match eligibility sheet</a> for a list of match eligble players this year.</li>
    <li>If there is ever a tie for the highest bid, a tiebreaker order is used to break the tie. When a manager wins an
        auction via the tiebreaker they are moved
        to the bottom of the tiebreaker order. The current tiebreaker order can be found in the <a
            href="{{url_for('tiebreaker.index')}}">tiebreaker order page</a>.</li>
    <li>Every Sunday at 5pm ET and Wednesday at 8pm ET a round of 28 player auctions will close (28 players per round *
        2 rounds per week = 56 players per week).</li>
    <li>Each round has a nomination period that starts 7 days before and ends 4 days before the round of player auctions
        closes.</li>
    <li>Managers can nominate up to two players in each round during the nomination period. When managers make a
        nomination they also make an initial bid - this initial bid can be updated but it cannot be removed.</li>
    <li>Managers can bid on any and all auctions between the time the nomination is made and the time that auction
        closes.</li>
    <li>The highest bid wins the auction. The highest bid becomes the minimum total salary.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Assigning Contracts</h3>
<p>Once a player has been won in auction the player will appear on their teams roster and the manager can sign them
    to a contract. Managers can modify their players' contracts through the end of free agency on March 10. Contracts
    must meet the minimum contracts specified in the <a target="_blank"
        href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kgbaJwiIzM4mq9iLhm8pI0_-MsZcjrV_YETkNyeBZZM/edit?usp=sharing">salary
        cap and contracts sheet</a>. Only valid contracts will be given as options in the signing page. </p>
<ul>
    <li>Note that the annual salary x contract length may end up being slightly greater than the total salary because
        weâ€™re always rounding up the annual salary value when the total salary cannot be divided evenly. For example -
        if you win a bid with a $82 total salary, your contract options are 1-year at $82, 2-years at $41 or 3 years at
        $28. In the 3 year option case the annual salary of $27.33 ($82 / 3 = $27.33) is rounded up to $28, and so the
        total salary ends up being $28 * 3 = $84. Therefore your auction bid is technically the minimum total salary
        depending on whether the annual salary needs to be rounded up. You may (or may not) want to take this into
        consideration when making your bids.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reminders</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Going forward only players signed to 2+ year contracts will be match eligible.</li>
    <li>Once free agency closes the waiver wire opens back up which you can use to fill any remaining open roster spots.
        Waiver wire claims process on Sunday nights and - similarly to the free agency auction - the highest bidder wins
        the claim and the player assigned a contract with the bid equaling their total salary.</li>
</ul>
